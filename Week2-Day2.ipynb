During physical therapy on the acute ward, the patient experienced coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea with any change of position or deep breathing. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, a step-by-step approach was used for position changes. The breathing exercises were adapted to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation, and with close monitoring, the patient managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level. Exercise progression was low initially but increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.\n",
